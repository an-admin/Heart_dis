# Heart Disease Prediction App

This application predicts the likelihood of heart disease based on user-provided medical attributes. It leverages machine learning models from `scikit-learn` and provides a user-friendly interface using `Streamlit`. The app is deployed on the web.

## Features

- Predicts the probability of heart disease using a machine learning model.
- User-friendly interface built with `Streamlit`.
- Web-deployed application for accessibility.

## Accuracy

The machine learning model used in this app achieves an accuracy of 86% on the dataset it was trained on. Performance metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score may vary based on user input and dataset characteristics.

## Usage

To use the application locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
git clone https://github.com/an-admin/Heart_dis.git
